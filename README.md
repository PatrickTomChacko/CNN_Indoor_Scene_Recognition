# CNN_Indoor_Scene_Recognition
A convolutional neural network that views image and classifies as which part of the house it is
The folder data_indoor.zip contains images concerning different indoor scenes from rooms and locations commonly
present in a standard family home. The task is to predict the type of room/scene present in the image. Indoor scene
recognition is a challenging problem since some indoor scenes can be well defined by global spatial and structural properties, while others are better characterized by the objects included in the space.
